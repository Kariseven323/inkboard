Updated scripts/coverage.sh to use Python filter_lcov.py for consistent filtering; Modified .github/workflows/flutter_ci.yml to enforce filtered coverage threshold via scripts/coverage.sh --filter-only with COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=90. Local lcov filtered coverage currently ~87.48%, so CI will fail unless tests improve or excludes adjusted. Last two commits: 474dd4e (sprint2-5), f55fb00 (布局与侧边栏改造并同步更新测试).
